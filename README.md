# PDF-Chatbot-with-Streamlit-and-OpenAI
This project demonstrates building a Streamlit application that interacts with a custom PDF using OpenAI's embedding and Pinecone for vector indexing. The app allows users to chat with the content of a PDF, providing a unique and interactive way to query and understand documents.
